  All sales are final unless the product arrives damaged, incorrect, or incomplete (e.g., missing items).
  If you believe there is an issue with your order, contact us promptly so we can review and help.
</p>
<p><strong>2. Reporting window</strong></p>
<p>
  Requests must be submitted within <strong>7 days</strong> of delivery. Claims submitted after this window may be
  denied.

  Do not ship products back without written authorization. Unauthorized returns may be refused or handled
  case-by-case, and a restocking fee of up to $100 may be deducted from any customer credit.
</p>
<p><strong>4. Evidence and packaging</strong></p>
<p>
  When submitting a request, please include your order number and a clear description of the issue. For damaged
  shipments, include photos of the outer box, inner packaging, and the product label(s). Please keep all original
  packaging until the issue is resolved.

<p class="p2">Effective: Dec 17, 2025</p>
<p class="p2">1. Order Processing</p>
<p class="p3">Orders are reviewed Monday through Thursday, excluding federal holidays, to ensure products are not held in a third-party warehouse over an extended period, such as weekends.

<p class="p2">2. Verification</p>
<p class="p3">PepPro may request additional documentation, such as for the person signing for orders to meet regulatory requirements. Orders pending verification will not ship until review is complete.</p>

    The Physicians' Choice Program is designed exclusively for medical professionals who order 25 units or more
    of a single product. Participants can choose to private label their products and/or utilize our 3PL Fulfillment
    Program for seamless inventory and distribution management.

      Physicians who opt to private label will collaborate with their Regional Administrator to provide logos and
      branding details for custom product labels.

      For those wishing to customize beyond the standard PepPro label design&mdash;such as changing colors, layout, or
      branding&mdash;we will provide a die line template for your designer to create your preferred look and feel. If design
      assistance is needed, we can connect you with a trusted graphic design partner.
